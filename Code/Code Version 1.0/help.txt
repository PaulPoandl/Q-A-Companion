This program is a graphical user interface chatbot application that uses the PyQt5 library for GUI design and the NLTK library for language processing. The chatbot functionality is implemented through the nltk.chat.util.Chat class, which uses pattern matching to determine the chatbot's response.

The Q&A Companion program enables users to create and use their own Q&A response sheets. While the program comes with pre-made Q&A response sheets, its main aim is to allow users to create their own custom response sheets with their own rules. This can be done by selecting a .txt file containing a set of patterns and corresponding responses. The program then uses the Natural Language Toolkit (nltk) library to match the user's input with the patterns in the response sheet and return the appropriate response.

The response-sheet system in a pattern-response system is built of wildcards and patterns. In this system, the chatbot is programmed with a list of patterns and corresponding responses. When a user inputs text, the chatbot matches the input against its list of patterns to find the best match. The chatbot then generates a response based on the corresponding response for the matched pattern.

A pattern, in the context of natural language processing and chatbots, refers to a specific text string or group of strings that the chatbot is designed to recognize and respond to. The pattern serves as a trigger for the chatbot to generate a response. Wildcards are symbols used in patterns to represent one or more characters in a user's input. Wildcards allow the chatbot to match a wider range of user inputs while still being able to generate a relevant response.

There are several types of wildcards, including:

"*" : Represents zero or more characters
"_" : Represents a single word
"|" : Represents "or" - a pattern can match if either pattern before or after the | symbol matches. This also works with responses but not at the same time with patterns.
"?" : Matches any single character
"+" : Matches one or more characters
"[]" : Matches a set of characters. For example, [aeiou] matches any vowels or [hi|hello]
"{}" : Matches a specific number of characters. For example, {2,4} matches between 2 and 4 characters.
"^" : Matches the start of a line (not always necessary)
"$" : Matches the end of a line (not always necessary)

A pattern is written in the format pattern = response. Here are some examples of patterns that incorporate wildcards:

I am feeling * = "Why are you feeling that way?"
What is your favorite * = "I am an AI language model, I don't have personal preferences."
Hi|Hello|Hey = "Hello! How can I help you today?"
I have a * problem = "What kind of problem is it?"
Hello|Hi = "Hello!"
What can you do for me = "Lot of things.|What you like!"
What do you do for * = "A lot of things!"
What do you do with your time+ = "Being an Assistant for you!"
What are your favorite [Games|Series|Plays] = "I do not like anything!"
What are {1,5} = "A number."

These are just a few examples to give you an idea of how patterns can be constructed and used. Keep in mind that the pattern-response system can become a complex and very good system. So, when you spend enough time and you know how it works, you could make your own chatbot. You only need to build the response-sheet. It should look like the example above, make sure not to make empty lines, and follow the rules mentioned!
